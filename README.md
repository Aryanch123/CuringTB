# CuringTB
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a formidable global health challenge, demanding innovative approaches
for diagnosis and treatment. This research embarks on a comprehensive exploration of machine
learning algorithms applied to TB research, with a focus on identifying the top 20 compounds with the
highest potential for curing TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Leveraging a dataset
encompassing 775 instances, we rigorously evaluate the performance of five prominent machine
learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine
(SVM), and Logistic Regression. Our analysis goes beyond the traditional boundaries of algorithm
performance assessment. It ventures into uncharted territory by seeking to uncover the compounds
that could revolutionize TB treatment strategies.
Through the collective efforts of these machine learning models, we unveil a select group of
compounds, each demonstrating a remarkable potential to combat TB. These compounds, which
transcend the limitations of traditional drug discovery methods, hold the promise of significantly
reducing the global burden of TB. Our findings not only represent a significant advancement in the
realm of TB research but also pave the way for future endeavors in pharmaceutical science. By
harnessing the power of machine learning, we contribute to the ongoing battle against TB, providing
new hope for millions of individuals affected by this resilient disease.
